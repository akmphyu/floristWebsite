        <h1>About Aspect</h1>
        <p>Most of our clients come from such demanding and creative fields such as fashion, entertainment, advertising, finance, publishing, and hospitality. Each project provides an inspirational challenge to enhance the clients' environment.<br>
        The aim of Aspect was to be a contemporary florist with a flair for creating innovative and attention seeking designs using fresh quality flowers and to create for those looking for that 'something special' with an individual edge.

        <h1>Founder of Aspect</h1>
        <p>Belinda Aspect founded Aspect in April 1985 and is a leading expert on green floral design. Belinda’s floral design experience began in high school with a part time job at a local flower shop, but her passion for flowers was put on the back burner as she pursued her college degree in Urban Studies with an emphasis in Public Administration at TAFE. She occasionally worked for a friend’s flower shop, but it wasn’t until she moved to New York County after graduation that her passion was rediscovered. She had designed a half dozen weddings before taking on the challenge of doing her own (which she doesn’t recommend to brides!). It was a huge success and Aspect was officially born.<br><br>
Belinda's dual passions for floral design and sustainability were merged when she decided that <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Aspect would “go green”</span>.
